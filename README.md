## 📖 What This Project Teaches

A complete authentication workflow built from scratch:

- 🧠 What is authentication & why it's needed
- 🍪 Cookies and how they travel across pages
- 🔒 Sessions and their difference from cookies
- 🔧 Setting cookies securely using `cookie-parser`
- 🔐 Password encryption using `bcrypt`
- 🧂 Understanding `salt` & hashing (non-reversible!)
- ✅ Building `/register` & `/login` APIs
- 🪙 JWT – what, why, and how (`sign`, `verify`, `decode`)
- 📦 Using `jsonwebtoken` and `.env` secrets
